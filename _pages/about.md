### Welcome to My Website

Hello everyone, I'm Matheus Henrique, a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in data and a passion for leveraging it to solve complex problems. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from UFTM and am currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science and Analytics at USP-ESALQ.

Professionally, I’m a Python Data Scientist at Turing, where I collaborate on LLM engineering for one of the top FAANG companies, focusing on Conversational AI systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Over the past few years, I’ve developed expertise in Data Analysis, Business Intelligence, and Machine Learning, with experience working for companies like DiDi Chuxing (99). My work centers on building and optimizing machine learning models, developing data-driven solutions, and providing actionable insights to stakeholders.

I’m passionate about using technology to drive innovation, and I’m always eager to learn more and contribute to impactful projects. Thank you for visiting, and I hope to share my journey and insights with you.
