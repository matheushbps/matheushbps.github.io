### Welcome to My Website <img src="images/google_mat.png" alt="Google Mat" width="300" height="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

Hello, I’m Matheus Henrique Batista Palmieri, a Data Scientist with extensive experience in data analysis, machine learning, and applied AI. Over three years at DiDi, the global leader in mobility services, I honed my skills in data-driven decision-making, developing predictive models and consolidating key performance metrics across multiple markets. Currently, I work with Turing on high-impact projects for a leading FAANG company, focusing on enhancing Conversational AI through advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) to boost response quality and model accuracy.

With expertise in SQL, Python, and machine learning, I bring a focused approach to data science that emphasizes practical insights and results. I am also skilled in data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau, making complex analyses clear and actionable for stakeholders. My work in NLP, supported by frameworks such as PyTorch and Hugging Face, enables me to tackle challenging natural language processing projects. On this site, you’ll find updates on my projects, research, and perspectives on data science. I’m excited to connect with professionals in the field and explore innovative applications of AI and data science in real-world contexts.
